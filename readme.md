## spider for 88x31 badges
A simple 88x31 button scanner writen in golang

At this time, it generates a lot of unnecessary requests and shouldn't be run on your machine

TODO:
- add logging
- optimize crawling
- add cli arguments

Inspired by [this cool project](https://github.com/Milk-Cool/Spider8831)
